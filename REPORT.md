## MISSION REPORT

	It took me 3 days to complete the missions as i projected during the pre-planning of the mission. 
	
	I drafted schedules to accomplish the missions. while considering efficiency, I thought of the best possible way to design the UI mock up and without breaking the rules of the challenge.


#### first step (pre-planning)
	"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and i will spend the first four sharpening the Axe" yep! i spent most of the time thinking of how to implement the UI mock up. 
	
	While obeying strictly to the rule "produce high fidelity UI mock Up" I had to think of the best frameworks and libraries to use while considering efficiency to design a mock up with highest possible fidelity to the screen shots found in the front-end resources folder.
	
	
#### second step (designing the UI mock up)
	At this point it is just about virtual coming into existence. I didn't spent much time programming the UI mock up since i already knew what libraries and frameworks to use, and how to implement them. In which i have thought of during pre-planning period.
	
	
#### third step (comparing both mockups)
	It is time to compare! This phase took much time than the second step. it is at this phase i realized that there is difference in fonts of both UI mock ups. in which am defeating a rule. so i had to know the fonts of the initial UI so i could implement in my design.
	
	As i was allowed to explore other sources and tools on net for support, i had to use some online tool to help me analyze the fonts of the initial mock up and implement in my solution.
	
	I tested my mock up by viewing it on different popular browsers and i noticed some slight glitches on some browsers. With few adjustments to my design code i solved those glitches.
	
	
#### fourth step (Extending the mock Up)
	This phase is about using my creativity to implement a feature to the UI mock up without altering fonts, colors, positions of other elements in the mock up. while sticking to producing high fidelity mock up rule. I made sure the new feature fits into the mock up without looking odd to the mock up design.
